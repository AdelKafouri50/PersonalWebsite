My team has been working with him for 6 months to build the first version of our startup's product, and I can't imagine getting this far without him \n His technical skills are excellent, but he's also very creative and has a great eye for design. He's comfortable executing on specific requirements as well as providing thought partnership on more nebulous projects. I wish I could hire him full-time.",
