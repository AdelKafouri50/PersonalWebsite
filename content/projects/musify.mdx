# The Story Behind it

This is actually one of my favorite projects, because it was one of the first projects I worked on. It actually had quite a few iterations. It started out as, believe it or not, a **Pokedex**. I was learning **React** at the time, and I wanted to make something interesting, after I built the Pokedex, I kept thinking, what else could I possibly make? Then I thought Hmmm... why don't I turn those pokemon into songs ðŸ˜‚.
<br/>
This is how it looked like:

# The Tech Stack


The tech stack I used for this project was pretty simple, I used **Django** & **Django Rest Framework** for the backend, **PostgreSQL** for the database, **React** for the frontend framework, and **Vanilla CSS** for styling.

# First Iteration

The first itiration was just me switching out the pokemon to songs, and then figuring out how the sound API works. It was quite a challenge at first, especially that I was still learning react at the time, so I actually had pretty much no idea what I was doing ðŸ¤”. The first design was honestly awful ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ’€. The colors were all over the place, there was no structure for the components, and there was no **Custom Music Player**.
<br/>
Here's the ugly first design:

# Design

In order to get the design going, I spent hours on hours watching [Gary Simon's](https://www.youtube.com/c/DesignCourse) videos on 2x speed. The guy is a design genius, and I learned so much about design principals from him, from **Typography**, to **Visual Hirearchy**, to **Color Theory**.
