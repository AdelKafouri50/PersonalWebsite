# The Back Story

This project was purely made to feed my **curiousity**, it was back when I was in university studying **Computer Engineering**, we had plenty of hardware and **low-level** engineering courses, like **Electrical Circuits**, **Digital Logic**, **Signals & Systems**, etc... So after taking a few of these courses, I decided to dive deeper into these topics and try to make **something on my own**. 

# How It Worked

The starting point was actually pretty simple, basically the way it worked is, there were **2 circuits**, one has a laser source powered by a battery, and the other one has an alarm sound source, and an **LDR - (Light Dependent Resistor)**. The laser source was pointed at the LDR, **opening the circuit**, once the laser beem gets **blocked**, the circuit is **closed** and the alarm **goes off**.

# Taking it to the next level

After getting the **basic funcitonality** to work, and getting that hit of dopamine, I thought why not make it a little **smarter**, so I added some more **ICs (Integrated Circuits)** to it and gave it a little bit of a **memory**, meaning once the laser beem is **blocked**, the circuit **saves the state** and the alarm keeps beeping until you press the **reset button**.

<br/>

Figuring this functionality out was pretty **challenging** because I didn't have any source of information so I was pretty much going with **trial and error** at that point, but the joy I had after getting it to work, and especially getting it to stop beeping when I press the reset button was definitely **worth the struggle**.
