# The Basic Idea

A Weight Tracker application made to keep track of daily weigh-ins and **charts** them to show a nice **graph** of fitness progress.

# Technologies used

The app was built with **NextJS**, **TailwindCSS**, **Auth0**, **MongoDB**, and **ReactChartJS**.

# How it works


The idea behind it is very simple, you create an account and you login, then you log your weight daily, or whenever you want really, and the app shows you a **graph** of your weight trend over time, to see if your fitness endeavors are going in the right direction or not.

As you can see above, all you have to do is just add the weight, and **optionally** you can track your Macros, and foods for the day as well.

# The motivation behind it

I've wanted to make the app for a while because I've personally been working on my fitness for years and years now, and when I finally decided to make it, it's actually been **extremely useful**.


# Thoughts after making it

I've been using it **every single day** since I made it, and I've tracked months of progress, and seeing the weight graph go down is really motivating, and not just that, it also shows you what works at what doesn't, because the graph doesn't lie, plain and simple.

This above is my personal weight graph, and as you can see, the graph just shows you whenever your diet and excercise plan are working, and when they're not.
