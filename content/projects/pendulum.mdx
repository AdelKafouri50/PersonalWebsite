# A Little Story

This app was in the works for around a **year**, there were many ideas and iterations, the basic idea behind it was a way to **handle payments** between businesses, small, and large. You send bills to people who owed you money, and they pay the bills and send you the money, plain and simple.

# Stripe

It had all kinds of payments solutions, from **Card Payments**, to **ACH payments** (Bank transfers).
The payments were handled with **Stripe**, and oh man was stripe connect a pain to work with. The documentation for stripe connect wasnt that fruitful so it took hours upon hours of trial and error, and reading documention, and watching videos, etc... but it all **worked out** in the end.

# Plaid

The ACH payments were handled with **Plaid** - A third party API that works with stripe. <br/><br/> Implementing plaid wasn't difficult because the documentation is well made and presented in multiple languages, so both the frontend & backend implementations were **moderately easy**.

# Auth and Database

The user authenticaiton was all made custom with **django** & **django rest framework**, and **PostgreSQL** was the **Database** of choice.

# Animations

The animations in the app were done using the **GSAP** library.

# Styling

All the styling was done with **custom CSS** to allow for as much customization as possible. Looking back at it now, I think it would've been possible to use a framework like **TailwindCSS** to make the development process faster and **more efficient**.

# React

The frontend framework of choice was React, and that was after some back and forth between me and my client, because they were working with **django templates**, and they didn't know that React can take the web app to a **whole new level**, but they were convinced and I **migrated** the building blocks from the django templates, to react and went from there.

# The Unfortunate Ending

The app had so much potential because so much work was put into it, so many functionalities were built, and went through so many iterations. Unfortunately though, the development was put on halt for **financial reasons**.
