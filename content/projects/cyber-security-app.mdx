# The App

The app is a cyber security dashboard with plenty of features. It was built for cyber security engineers to detect and resolve leakages in real time. Unfortunately a lot of the information is confidential, but I'll try to give a brief overview of the app without breaking confidentiality.

# The Tech Stack

The app was built with **NextJS**, **TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS**

# The Process

The MVP was built with weekly sprints focusing on individual features. Some of the features included:

- Search
- Notifications
- Filtering
- Sorting
- Charts

And more.

# The Result

There were a few iterations done after the MVP was successfully launched, more features were added and end to end tests were applied, and the app was **sold** to multiple companies.

# The Review

"It was great to work with Adel on our project, we are waiting to collaborate in the near future...." - **Amos Stern**
