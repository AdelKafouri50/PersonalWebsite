# My Story
As someone who's struggled with being overweight for a good portion of my life, I've made it one of my life missions to discover the world of fitness and nutrition, so I dedicated a few years of my life to it.  
<br/>
**Fun fact**: I actually considered dropping out of university and pursuing a career in fitness, but thankfully, these thoughts never got the best of me ðŸ˜‚â€‹.
<br/>  
So here's a quick guide for some of the fundamentals I've learned during that period.
<br/>




# 1. Calories in Vs Calories out.  
    - The single most important part of every single diet plan is **calories**.  
        - Calories in < Calories out = **Weight loss**.  
        - Calories in > Calories out = **Weight gain**.  
        - Calories in = Calories out = **Weight maintenance**.  
<br/>
# 2. Calculating your **TDEE**
         Total Daily Energy Expenditure-, in other words **how many calories you burn a day**.
        Your TDEE is comprised of a number of **components**:
            <br/>  
            - Basal Metabolic Rate or **BMR**:  
            The number of calories your body burns everyday at rest just to keep you alive and functioning properly. Like **breathing**, **pumping blood**, **etc**.  
            <br/>
            - Exercise activity thermogenesis **EAT**:  
            The number of calories your body burns while exercising, like **weight training** and **cardio**.
            <br/>
            - Non-exercise activity thermogenesis **NEAT**:  
            The number of calories your body **burns while doing everyday activities** that are not considered exercise such as:
            simple daily tasks like **standing**, **talking** and **brushing your teeth**.  
            <br/>
            - Thermic effect of food **TEF**:  
            the number of calories your body burns **digesting** and processing food.
<br/>
# 3. Calculating the amount of calories you burn:
    <br/>
         An easy way to calculate your daily caloric maintenance is:
    **Body Weight in lbs x 14-17**  OR **Body Weight kg  x 30-37**.
     <br/>
         The only realistic way to truly find your exact calorie maintenance level is by doing a simple experiment:
            <br/>
            1. Consume the same amount of calories **everyday** for **2 weeks**.
                <br/>
                for example: take your **body weight in kg x 30**, so if you weigh around **100 kg** then the desired amount would be around **3000 kcal**.
            <br/> 
            2. Weigh yourself everyday and **save the result**. 
            <br/> 
            3. Get the weekly average of your weight by **adding** all the weekly weigh ins and **dividing** the number you get by **7**.
            <br/> 
            4. Repeat step **number 3** for another **week** and compare the average of the **first week** with the average of the **second week**.
            <br/> 
            5. if you find that you **gained 0.5 KG** for example, then the calories you were consuming were **more than** what your body burns every day, but if you find that you **lost 0.5 KG** then the calories you were consuming were **less than** what your body **burns** everyday.
            <br/> 
            6. **Adjust** the calories and try again to find exactly **how your body reacts**.
            <br/> 
            In general, **10-12 cal/lb** tends to be a decent starting point for **fat loss diets**.  
            Please note that this is only a **starting point**, and it will **most likely** have to be adjusted based on **real-world changes**.  
            Some people with **high activity** levels may need **higher calories** than that, and folks with **lower activity** levels may need **less**.
<br/>  
# 4. How macros affect fat loss:
<br/>
   Changing the macro-nutrient content of the diet can have a **small impact** in **fat loss**.  
    For the most part, **switching out** **carbs and fat doesnâ€™t** do much despite what many claim.
    <br/>
    <br/>    
    The difference in the thermic effect of food for **carbs vs. fat** is about **3%** so for every **100 calories** you switch out for the other, you might see a **3 calorie** difference in energy expenditure.
    <br/>
    <br/>  
    Now, **protein** has the **biggest impact** in terms of the **thermic effect** of food, switching out **carbs or fat** for **protein** tends to **increase**
    the energy outside of the equation, but you have to make
    pretty **large scale** changes for it to be particularly **significant**.  
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Protein also tends to be the most **filling** of all the macro-nutrients, and studies show that **increasing** dietary protein intake tends to **cause people to eat less calories**.  
    Which is another huge confound;
    <br/>
    <br/>
    *if **increasing** protein makes folks spontaneously **eat less**, it looks like it was **adding the protein** that did the magic. But it **wasnâ€™t***.
    <br/>
    <br/>  
    It was the effect of **increasing protein** on total energy intake that **caused** the **fat loss**.
<br/>
<br/>
# 5. How exercise affects fat loss:  
    <br/>
    Activity not only **increases** energy expenditure but also **impacts** the **quality** of weight loss **e.g. fat vs muscle** and can impact appetite **both positively or negatively** depending on the specifics.  
    <br/>
    The **problem** for most people is that the **amount of calories** that can be **expended** in exercise is not large.  
    <br/>
    An irony is that the only people who can usually **burn** a **ton of calories** in activity are **trained athletes**, and they usually **donâ€™t need** to **lose fat**.  
    <br/>
    But the **reality** is that an **hour** of activity for most people will **not burn** a **staggering number of calories**.  
    <br/>
    Usually, **caloric restriction** or a **combination** of **cutting calories** and **increasing activity** is going to be more **realistic**.
    <br/>

# In conclusion
 What you need to do is, **setup** a **caloric deficit** by using one of the methods mentioned above, focus on getting the **right** amount of **protein** **0.8-1.2** gram per **pound** of body weight, and most importantly, **stay consistent**.
